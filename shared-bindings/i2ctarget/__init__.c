//| """Two wire serial protocol target
//|
//| The `i2ctarget` module contains classes to support an I2C target.
//|
//| Example emulating a target with 2 addresses (read and write)::
//|
//|   import board
//|   from i2ctarget import I2CTarget
//|
//|   regs = [0] * 16
//|   index = 0
//|
//|   with I2CTarget(board.SCL, board.SDA, (0x40, 0x41)) as device:
//|       while True:
//|           r = device.request()
//|           if not r:
//|               # Maybe do some housekeeping
//|               continue
//|           with r:  # Closes the transfer if necessary by sending a NACK or feeding dummy bytes
//|               if r.address == 0x40:
//|                   if not r.is_read:  # Main write which is Selected read
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if not b or b[0] > 15:
//|                           break
//|                       index = b[0]
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if b:
//|                           regs[index] = b[0]
//|                   elif r.is_restart:  # Combined transfer: This is the Main read message
//|                       n = r.write(bytes([regs[index]]))
//|                   #else:
//|                       # A read transfer is not supported in this example
//|                       # If the microcontroller tries, it will get 0xff byte(s) by the ctx manager (r.close())
//|               elif r.address == 0x41:
//|                   if not r.is_read:
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if b and b[0] == 0xde:
//|                           # do something
//|                           pass
//|
//| This example sets up an I2C device that can be accessed from Linux like this::
//|
//|   $ i2cget -y 1 0x40 0x01
//|   0x00
//|   $ i2cset -y 1 0x40 0x01 0xaa
//|   $ i2cget -y 1 0x40 0x01
//|   0xaa
//|
//| .. warning::
//|    I2CTarget makes use of clock stretching in order to slow down
//|    the host.
//|    Make sure the I2C host supports this.
//|
//|    Raspberry Pi in particular does not support this with its I2C hw block.
//|    This can be worked around by using the ``i2c-gpio`` bit banging driver.
//|    Since the RPi firmware uses the hw i2c, it's not possible to emulate a HAT eeprom."""
