This port brings the Silicon Labs EFR32 series of MCUs to Circuitpython.

Refer to **mpconfigport.mk** for a full list of enabled modules sorted by family.

## How this port is organized ##

- **boards/** contains the configuration files for each development board and breakout available on the port, as well as system files and both shared and SoC-specific linker files. Board configuration includes a pin mapping of the board, oscillator information, board-specific build flags, and setup for other peripherals where applicable.
- **common-hal/** contains the port-specific module implementations, used by shared-module and shared-bindings.
- **peripherals/** contains peripheral setup files and peripheral mapping information, sorted by family and sub-variant. Most files in this directory can be generated with the python scripts in **tools/**.
- **supervisor/** contains port-specific implementations of internal flash and serial, as well as the **port.c** file, which initializes the port at startup.
- **tools/** contains the Silicon Labs Configurator (SLC) tool, python scripts for generating peripheral and pin mapping files in **peripherals/** and **board/**.

At the root level, refer to **mpconfigboard.h** and **mpconfigport.mk** for port specific settings and a list of enabled modules.

## Prerequisites ##

Please ensure you set up your build environment appropriately, as per the guide. You will need:

- Linux: <https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython/linux>
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): <https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython/windows-subsystem-for-linux>
- macOS: Not supported yet

Install necessary packages

    sudo apt install default-jre gcc-arm-none-eabi wget python3 python3-pip git git-lfs gettext uncrustify
    sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip

**Note** that this uses git lfs and will not link without it. The error is something like "Unknown file format" because git lfs has a text placeholder file.

## Build instructions ##

Ensure your clone of CircuitPython is ready to build by following the [guide on the Adafruit Learning System](https://learn.adafruit.com/building-circuitpython/build-circuitpython). This includes installing the toolchain, synchronizing submodules, and running `mpy-cross`.

Clone the source code of CircuitPython from GitHub:

    $  git clone https://github.com/SiliconLabs/circuitpython.git
    $  cd circuitpython/ports/silabs
    $  make fetch-port-submodules

Checkout the branch or tag you want to build. For example:

    git checkout main

Follow the guide below to install the required packages for the Silicon Labs Configurator (SLC):
    <https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug520-software-project-generation-configuration-with-slc-cli.pdf>

Once the one-time build tasks are complete, you can build at any time by navigating to the port directory:

    make BOARD=explorerkit_xg24_brd2703a

You may also build with certain flags available in the makefile, depending on your board and development goals:

    make BOARD=explorerkit_xg24_brd2703a DEBUG=1

Clean the project by using:

    make BOARD=explorerkit_xg24_brd2703a clean

## Flashing CircuitPython

Flash the project by using [Simplicity Commander](https://community.silabs.com/s/article/simplicity-commander?language=en_US):

    make BOARD=explorerkit_xg24_brd2703a flash


## Running CircuitPython ##

### Connecting to the Serial Console ###

Connect the devkit to the PC via the USB cable. The board uses serial for REPL access and debugging because the EFR32 chips has no USB support.

#### Windows ####

On Windows, we need to install a serial console e.g., PuTTY, MobaXterm. The JLink CDC UART Port can be found in the Device Manager.

#### Linux ####

Open a terminal and issue the following command:

    ls /dev/ttyACM*

Then note down the correct name and substitute `com-port-name` in the following command with it:

    screen /dev/'com-port-name'

### Using the REPL prompt ###

After flashing the firmware to the board, at your first connecting to the board, you might see a blank screen. Press enter and you should be presented with a Circuitpython prompt,`>>>`. If not, try to reset the board (see instructions below).

You can now type in simple commands such as:

    >>> print("Hello world!")
    Hello world!

If something goes wrong with the board, you can reset it. Pressing CTRL+D when the prompt is open performs a soft reset.

### Recommended editors ###

**Thonny** is a simple code editor that works with the Adafruit CircuitPython boards.

Config serial: Tools > Options > Interpreter > Select MicroPython > Select Port Jlink CDC UART Port

### Running CircuitPython scripts ###

At the boot stage, two scripts will be run (if not booting in safe mode). First, the file `boot.py` will be executed. The file `boot.py` can be used to perform the initial setup. Then, after `boot.py` has been completed, the file `code.py` will be executed.

After code.py has finished executing, a REPL prompt will be presented on the serial port. Other files can also be executed by using the **Thonny** editors or using **Ampy** tool.

With the boards which support USB mass storage, we can drag the files to the board file system. However, because the EFR32 boards donâ€™t support USB mass storage, we need to use a tool like **Ampy** to copy the file to the board. You can use the latest version of **Ampy** and its  command to copy the module directories to the board.

Refer to the guide below for installing the **Ampy** tool:
