Adafruit CircuitPython Libraries
================================

Documentation for all Adafruit-sponsored CircuitPython libraries is at:
<https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html>.


CircuitPython Library Bundles
=============================

Many Python libraries, including device drivers, have been written for use with CircuitPython.
They are maintained in separate GitHub repos, one per library.

Libraries are packaged in *bundles*, which are ZIP files that are snapshots in time of a group of libraries.

Adafruit sponsors and maintains several hundred libraries, packaged in the **Adafruit Library Bundle**.
Adafruit-sponsored libraries are also available on <https://pypi.org>.

Yet other libraries are maintained by members of the CircuitPython community,
and are packaged in the **CircuitPython Community Library Bundle**.

The Adafruit bundles are available on GitHub: <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases>.
The Community bundles are available at: <https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases>.

More detailed information about the bundles, and download links for the latest bundles
are at <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>.

Documentation about bundle construction is at: <https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/projects/bundle/en/latest/>.

Documentation for Community Libraries is not available on ReadTheDocs at this time. See the GitHub repository
for each library for any included documentation.
